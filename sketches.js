        <p>
          Ray-marching is an interesting rendering technique, I found out a few years ago in articles of
          <a target="_blank" href="http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/raymarchingdf/raymarchingdf.htm">Inigo Quilez</a>.
          With modern hardware, it allows amateurs like me, to experience a joy of creating phororealistic real-time procedural art,
          only requiring some basic linear algebra knowledge.

          Lighting artifacts in this scene are consequences of using naive shading. I need to figure out why this happends and fix it in
          future sketches.

          A nice, organic noise function. Fun to play with. Just by picking different colors one can get interesting results.
